const tipMessageCommitLength95 = 'You\'re supposed to write a short description of the '
+ 'work that was done, not the complete report for the client nor an official mail to the '
+ 'intention of the head of the company. You have to be concise yet clear. We know it\'s a '
+ 'hard skill to master, but it\'s necessary to know then to stop in order to be the G.O.A.T. '
+ 'in commit message redaction.';

const tipMessageCommitLength70 = 'We see that you put some extra effort in your commit '
+ 'message redaction, that\'s cool and all, but maybe you\'re taking this "detailing" '
+ 'thing a bit too far. You and your colleagues will have to read those, so maybe try to '
+ 'ease off on the keyboard, and go get yourself a chocolate milk. You deserved it ;-)';

const tipMessageCommitLength50 = 'Congratulation, fellow programmer. You now belong to '
+ 'the elite in term of writing a commit message. The bug fix description has no more '
+ 'secret to you. You can now wander in the vales of the Internet in order to spread the '
+ 'holy teaching. Keep your mind clear and your keys sharp. May the semi-colon be with you. Amen';

const tipMessageCommitLength25 = 'Hey not bad, you\'re doing pretty god ! But if you want to '
+ 'be the very best, like no one ever was, you still have to improve this legendary skill known '
+ 'as "write a good commit message". Maybe you were a bit vague in your message, or you missed a '
+ 'functionality/feature/fix/bug to comment. Keep on typing, you\'re close to excellence. #ThumbsUp';

const tipMessageCommitLength0 = 'Come on, you can and have to do longer commit messages. It\'s a '
+ 'description of your work, not a trivial text sent with your favorite messaging app. You don\'t have '
+ 'to write a book, but give as many informations as possible on what was done. Your team will be '
+ 'thankfull and they even might consider inviting you for a drink for being the "commit redactor of the year" :)';


const tipModifiedLinesCommit40 = 'You love living dangerously... Making such big changes '
+ 'before committing can make you loose everything. Try making less changes per commit or '
+ 'making commits more often. Imagine a sunday afternoon, you, coding in front of your computer '
+ '(behind it\'s way more difficult btw) and suddenly, after changing the core of your software, '
+ 'a T-Rex enters your room breaking your door with a high kick and eats your computer... No commit, '
+ 'no work done. Next time, you should commit more often, after little changes! :D';

const tipModifiedLinesCommit25 = '';
const tipModifiedLinesCommit15 = 'Parfait';
const tipModifiedLinesCommit10 = 'La sûreté ça te connait';

const tipModifiedLinesCommit0 = 'What the fuuuuuuuuuck man? Even my Grandma makes more changes per '
+ 'commit... I don\'t even know what to say! I mean, making a commit per line is not that good... '
+ 'When your colleagues pull the changes, if they want to catch up and read the commits, they will be '
+ 'lost in miserable changes and a tsunami of commits... Not so productive :/';


const tipLanguage8 = 'WOW, ok, you\'re curious, that\'s good, but you know it\'s a sin (not '
+ 'a big one though, but still) ? You\'re VERY versatile, but we doubt that you master every single '
+ 'language that you use. If that\'s the case, congratulation, you\'re the apex programmer. But otherwise '
+ 'you might consider reducing your arsenal in order to better use you weapons. Sure a Swiss Knife is useful, '
+ 'but you\'ll still use a kitchen knife to chop your vegetable.';

const tipLanguage5 = 'You try to be verstile but man, maybe you should focus on a little less tools. It\'s good '
+ 'to know some languages, but it\'s way better to master a few languages. This way you\'ll have the knowledge '
+ 'to use a little bit of everything, mais you\'ll also be able to increase you productivity on the mastered '
+ 'tools. Your colleagues will even be impressed by how confident you\'ll look by smashing your keys frenetically, '
+ 'typing your bubble-sort method at the light of speed :)';

const tipLanguage3 = 'Welp, what do you expect us to say ? You\'re pretty versatile as a programmer and you know what '
+ 'you\'re doing with your tools. That\'s a very appreciated set of skill that you have here. Try to keep using these '
+ 'languages as you need/want, but don\'t restrain yourself to use other languages.';

const tipLanguage2 = 'Hey we see that you\'re the proud expert of two wonderful languages. That\'s '
+ 'quite good but you know, curiosity isn\'t that bad as a sin, you\'re not restricted to use these only two '
+ 'tools. Try to add one or two other languages to your arsenal to increase your versatility. This kind of skill '
+ 'is very appreciated on the job market. Think about a domain in which you have some interest, or something '
+ 'complementary to the two you already know :)';

const tipLanguage0 = 'Most of your work is done with only one language, so there\'s two case possible : '
+ 'either you just created your account and did a very few project with it, or you are an apex programmer in '
+ 'this particular language. In both case, we encourage you to try out new languages, maybe check out a domain '
+ 'in which you\'re curious/not comfortable yet. But try to spare some time to keep on practicing your favorite '
+ 'language :)';


const tipIssue25 = 'Wow man, how was your trip to the East Siberian Taiga ecoregion? I hope '
+ 'it was fun because now, it\'s time to GET BACK TO WORK. No, really, getting issues done taking so much time... '
+ 'Your "working" with Candy Crush or what? Even Shakespare resolves issues more quickly...';

const tipIssue10 = 'Imagine you are in a Safari and you meet with a lion. You run, right? Because you know it\'s '
+ 'your life or the lion dinner... Well, issues are quite similar. As long as you do nothing, they will follow '
+ 'you. And following issues are worse than being served as dinner for a lion, believe me. So just do it, work '
+ 'harder and close those issues!';

const tipIssue3 = 'Hey, good rhythm. You resolve issues as well as Phil Collins play drums! Keep going on like '
+ 'that, your colleagues will love you for your efficiency and you won\'t be submerged by issues!';

const tipIssue0 = 'Ow man, you are either an amazing genius or a careless dev. If you\'re part of the first '
+ 'type, go on and be super GitHuber! On the other hand, take time to really think for durable solutions instead '
+ 'of quickly solving the issues to get back to your Cookie Clicker game... An issue solved without thinking is '
+ 'another issue coming right up!';
