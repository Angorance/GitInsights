+ 'hard skill to master, but it\'s necessary to know then to stop in order to be the G.O.A.T. '
+ 'in commit message redaction.';

const tipMessageCommitLength70 = 'We see that you put some extra effort in your commit '

const tipMessageCommitLength50 = 'Congratulation, fellow programmer. You now belong to '
+ 'the elite in term of writing a commit message. The bug fix description has no more '

const tipMessageCommitLength25 = 'Hey not bad, you\'re doing pretty god ! But if you want to '
+ 'be the very best, like no one ever was, you still have to improve this legendary skill known '
+ 'as "write a good commit message". Maybe you were a bit vague in your message, or you missed a '
+ 'functionality/feature/fix/bug to comment. Keep on typing, you\'re close to excellence. #ThumbsUp';

const tipMessageCommitLength0 = 'Come on, you can and have to do longer commit messages. It\'s a '
+ 'description of your work, not a trivial text sent with your favorite messaging app. You don\'t have '
+ 'to write a book, but give as many informations as possible on what was done. Your team will be '
+ 'thankfull and they event might consider inviting you for a drink for being the "commit redactor of the year" :)';
