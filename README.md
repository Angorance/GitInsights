# GitInsights

## What's for?

Our application is for giving an **insight** about GitHub accounts and their usage. Hence our application shows some statistics of the authenticated user and analyse his past commits / issues to give some tips on how to be a better GitHuber (or dev).

### What can you find

First of all, in the statistics section, you will find your favorite languages, the coded lines for the last 100 commits, the number of commits you've done so far, some stats aubout your assigned issues and about your repositories too.

In a second time, in the tips section, you will find an analysis of your 100 last commits (mostly to analyse the length of your commit messages and the changes done), one of your languages (too much, maybe not enough?) and one about the time you take to resolve some issues.

### Tips

The tips you get are based on our experience and need to be improved over time with your feedback and (maybe one day?) Machine Learning (keeping data in a database to be analysed). Plus you have to keep in mind the tips are for the majority of devs, some of them won't be suitable for extreme projects and some special conditions.

One more thing about the tips are the scores. Each section analysed is given a score (with color decoration). This way it's more *obvious* if the tip is good or bad, even if our tips are funny and quite understandable :D
