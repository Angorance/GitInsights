const tipMessageCommitLength95 = 'You\'re supposed to write a short description of the '
+ 'work that was done, not the complete report for the client nor an official mail to the '
+ 'intention of the head of the company. You have to be concise yet clear. We know it\'s a '
+ 'hard skill to master, but it\'s necessary to know then to stop in order to be the G.O.A.T. '
+ 'in commit message redaction.';

const tipMessageCommitLength70 = 'We see that you put some extra effort in your commit '
+ 'message redaction, that\'s cool and all, but maybe you\'re taking this "detailing" '
+ 'thing a bit too far. You and your colleagues will have to read those, so maybe try to '
+ 'ease off on the keyboard, and go get yourself a chocolate milk. You deserved it ;-)';

const tipMessageCommitLength50 = 'Congratulation, fellow programmer. You now belong to '
+ 'the elite in term of writing a commit message. The bug fix description has no more '

const tipMessageCommitLength25 = 'Hey not bad, you\'re doing pretty god ! But if you want to '
+ 'be the very best, like no one ever was, you still have to improve this legendary skill known '
+ 'as "write a good commit message". Maybe you were a bit vague in your message, or you missed a '
+ 'functionality/feature/fix/bug to comment. Keep on typing, you\'re close to excellence. #ThumbsUp';

const tipMessageCommitLength0 = 'Come on, you can and have to do longer commit messages. It\'s a '
+ 'description of your work, not a trivial text sent with your favorite messaging app. You don\'t have '
+ 'to write a book, but give as many informations as possible on what was done. Your team will be '
+ 'thankfull and they even might consider inviting you for a drink for being the "commit redactor of the year" :)';


const tipModifiedLinesCommit40 = 'You love living dangerously... Making such big changes '
+ 'before committing can make you loose everything. Try making less changes per commit or '
+ 'making commits more often. Imagine a sunday afternoon, you, coding in front of your computer '
+ '(behind it\'s way more difficult btw) and suddenly, after changing the core of your software, '
+ 'a T-Rex enters your room breaking your door with a high kick and eats your computer... No commit, '

+ 'When your colleagues pull the changes, if they want to catch up and read the commits, they will be '
+ 'lost in miserable changes and a tsunami of commits... Not so productive :/';
